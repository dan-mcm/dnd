## Current WIP Component Focus:

### Spell Search Component

- Additional filters could be implemented - user input search

### Dice Component

- Add user customizable D field amount e.g. D24.
- Track history of previously rolled dice.
- 'Roll All' option to roll multiple dice at the same time.
- On mobile devices images are slightly off - could be optimized for mobile responsiveness.

### Potential Future Additions

- Skill Search Component -> similar in functionality to the Spell Search.
- DM Screen Component -> useful basic information reference for D&D campaigns.
- Character Sheet Component -> Online form completion & download.
- Music Component -> Open sourced music tracks for campaigns - potentially use spotify plugin with playlist.
