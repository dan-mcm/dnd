# DM Toolkit

A React application designed to aid Dungeon Masters running D&D campaigns.

## Current WIP Component Focus:

### Spell Search Component

- Currently displays results inside Search component, should ideally render results in Spacer component.
- Additional filters could be implemented - considering alphabetical nature of list not a big priority.

### Dice Component

- On mobile devices images are slightly off - could be optimized for mobile responsiveness.
- Alignment of divs changes on dice roll results being displayed - could be optimized for better UX - fixed height maybe.
- 'Roll All' option to roll multiple dice at the same time.

## Potential Future Additions

- Skill Search Component -> similar in functionality to the Spell Search.
- DM Screen Component -> useful basic information reference for D&D campaigns.
- Character Sheet Component -> Online form completion & download.
- Music Component -> Open sourced music tracks for campaigns - potentially use spotify plugin with playlist.
